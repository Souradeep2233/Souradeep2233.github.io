        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently in my third year of pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. With a CGPA of 9.3/10, I have demonstrated a strong academic foundation and a keen understanding of complex concepts.</p>

        <p>My profound interest in vision research and statistics has driven me to delve deep into these fields, where I aim to contribute through innovative research and practical applications. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of computer vision to solve real-world problems and the critical role that statistical analysis plays in interpreting and improving machine learning models.</p>

        <p>Currently as a research intern at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, and a research assistant at IEDC (CEDS), Kolkata, I have gained valuable hands-on experience in deep learning and computer vision projects. My work has involved developing sophisticated topics such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>I. Zero Shot Learning</li>
            <li>II. Domain Generalization</li>
            <li>III. Use of Meta Learning</li>
            <li>IV. Stable Diffusion</li>
            <li>V. Vision Transformers</li>
            <li>VI. Segmentation Models</li>
            <li>VII. Bi-directional LSTMs</li>
            <li>VIII. Conditional GANs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My current research focuses on Zero Shot Learning accompanied by Meta Learning on Satellite Images, giving a way to Open World Learning in satellite data. This project explores innovative methodologies to recognize and classify objects in satellite images, even in scenarios where the classes are not predefined. By leveraging the power of meta-learning techniques, we aim to build models capable of adapting to new environments and learning from limited data.</p>

        <p>This project not only challenges traditional approaches to object recognition but also has profound implications for various applications, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and urban planning.</p>

        <p>I am eager to continue my journey in the realm of vision research, exploring new methodologies and contributing to the advancement of this exciting field. With a strong foundation in programming languages, frameworks, and cloud platforms, I am well-equipped to take on challenging research endeavors and collaborate with like-minded professionals to make meaningful impacts.</p>
